<h1 class="guide-section__title">Human-Centered Design</h1>
<h2>What is HCD?</h2>
<p>Human-Centered Design (HCD) is a problem-solving framework that helps make systems and products more responsive to the people, who we will call participants throughout this Guide, who use those systems and products. It requires rigorous qualitative research, directing that research towards the goal of deeply understanding the needs, insights, and emotions of customers. By using Human-Centered Design, we can focus our time, resources, and energy on solutions and innovations that make service delivery effective, easy, and in tune with the emotions of our participants.</p>
<p>HCD involves four phases of sequential work: discovery, design, delivery, and measurement. HCD is also cyclical. Once a design solution is launched, we measure its effectiveness against initial and intended aims, and then we continually tweak it, thus improving the solution over time. HCD recognizes that people and their needs are dynamic and changing and so our solutions must be dynamic and changing.

  <p>HCD allows us to understand the types of experiences participants want from a system, product or service. We refer to the customers’ desired experience as the “front stage” of the design effort. HCD also helps us craft the processes that create
    those desired experiences. We refer to this behind-the-scenes work as “the back stage” of the design effort. By tending to the front stage and the back stage, HCD allows us to put the customer at the center of our design development.</p>

  <p>The HCD approach has already created immense value in advancing public sector missions. For example, redesigning USAJOBS, the hub for federal hiring where nearly 1 billion job searches are done annually by over 180 million people, has resulted in a 30% reduction in help desk tickets after the first round of improvements. Not only does this reflect an easier experience for those involved in the hiring process, this change also creates savings in support costs.</p>

  <h2>HCD Process</h2>
  <p>HCD is a cyclical process with different phases, and each phase moves between divergent and convergent modes of thinking. In Discovery, a team diverges through desk research, then converges on a problem frame, and diverges again when listening to the points of view of the participants. </p>
  <p> In the Design phase, idea generation, also called ideation, requires divergent thinking, then convergence around a few viable options to prototype and test. This prototyping and testing also requires that the team start considering the potential measurement points for the designed product or solution. These measurement points include a spectrum of measuremnets built on both quantitative and qualitative data points. This will allow the deisgn team and stakeholders to gain a robust evaulation the product or service, once it has been deployed.</p>
  <p>Delivery includes divergence around modes of delivery and collaboration with implementation teams, then convergence around an workable model. The creation of measurement points also exist in this phase. Since the delivery of and access to a product or service is an integral part of that product's or service's success, the team should build qualitative and quantitative measurement points into this phase as well.</p>
  <p>Finally, the Measurement requires that the team and stakeholders not only converge around the collection the data from the measurement points built in the previous sections, but also think divergently in their parsing of that data. Divergent thinking in this phase is also known as interpreting the data, or creating understanding or meaning from the data. The data itself will not give the team and stakeholders insights and direction on where to go next; the interpretation of data provides those. </p>
  <p>At each stage, the team is aware that a return to a previous stage might be necessary. This process is not strictly linear, progressing from one stage to another; it is subject to informed and intentional revision at all points. The balance between when to move forward and when to revise is sometimes a tough one to strike, but through practice and mentorship through this process, practicioners can refine their instincts for when this balance point.
  </p>
  <p>By using HCD in our work to improve agency services, we can identify innovations or solutions that are desirable, feasible, and viable. We design the solution, launch it, and measure its effectiveness against our initial
    goals. If the solution falls short of those goals, we make revisions based on further feedback from users and test it again. Such dynamism is inherent to the HCD process. HCD solutions are designed to be dynamic and changing because the people and situations for whom we are designing will themselves be dymnamic and subject to change over time.

  <h2>HCD Phases: A Breakdown</h2>
  <h3>Discovery</h3>
  <p><img class="bubbles_right" src="images/bubbles-discovery-01.svg">This design guide series began with the Discovery phase. Two guides are available for that phase: the Concept Guide and the Operations Guide. In Discovery, you built a problem frame, observed situations and listened to participants and stakeholders, synthesized your findings, and communicated them to your supervisors and other stakeholders. You should have completed or be near completing your Discovery phase as you pick up this Design Phase Field Guide. </p>

  <h3>Design</h3>
  <p><img class="bubbles_left" src="images/bubbles-design-01.svg">With your insights gathered and opportunities defined, you enter the Design phase. In this phase, you start building prototypes and working through design ideas. You won't try to perfect these too soon. Instead, you will prioritize iteration, testing, and making incremental refinements. Build, test and repeat. As the team and stakeholders converge around a best product or service solution, you will begin to refine it, making format or delivery platform decisions, and starting to see how it might look as a Delivered solution.
  </p>

  <h3>Deliver</h3>
  <p><img class="bubbles_right" src="images/bubbles-deliver-01.svg">After prototyping and testing, you will work with implementation teams and other stakeholders to create a small pilot and test the logistical needs around the luanch of your design work.</p>

  <h3>Measure</h3>
  <p class="center_text clearfix"><img class="bubbles_left" src="images/bubbles-measure-01.svg" />In the Measure phase, you gather quantitative and qualitative data to learn if the goals and expectations of your work are being met. When applied, this data will help improve your design.</p>

  <h2>Working with HCD</h2>
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>This section provides a brief conceptual background for Human-Centered Design (HCD). While not exhaustive, this summary explains that HCD is a rigorous social science methodology used by groups in the public and private sectors in order to understand
    complex, interrelated problems for the purpose of crafting dynamic solutions.</p>

  <h3>Basics of the HCD Approach</h3>
  <p>Human-Centered Design is grounded in empathy and understanding. It always begins with observation and research. We hear from people in their own words for the purpose of gaining an understanding of what they want, expect, and need from a system, product, or experience.</p>
  <h3>HCD and LEAN</h3>
  <div>
  <p>

  </p>
</div>
  <p>HCD and LEAN complement each other. Both build solutions based on a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data. HCD largely draws from qualitative data in the building of these solutions, while LEAN depends heavily on quantitative data in solution-creation. Both methods rely on the ideas and actions of Ease and Effectiveness, two components of exceptional service delivery. Easily quantifiable, LEAN highlights those exceptional service delivery attributes. Emotion, the third attribute, requires more qualitative data collection to understand. Although LEAN integrates some emotional components of the participants' experience, it does not center on them or allow for the large-scale questioning of the entire system inself. HCD, on the other hand, centers on the participants' emotional experience and allows for broad questioning of the system itself and its component parts. For this reason, HCD's qualitative data-based approach to solution-finding complements LEAN's quantitative data-based approach.

      What people say, and what people do, and what people say they do are entirely different things.
      <span>— Dr. Margaret Mead, Anthropologist</span>
  </div>

  <p>Human-Centered Design and other qualitative research methodologies investigate and help sort out the root causes of conflicts like the one above by Dr. Margaret Mead. LEAN and other quantitative methodologies allow for the understanding of current system states and the rational elimination of mechanical and nonhuman inefficiencies in systems.</p>

  <p>
  An additional nuance: quantitative data is, by definition, historical and evaluative: in order to be collected, the actions and events quantified in this data has to have already occurred. The data is a record of what has happened in the system that exists. For this reason, LEAN-generated solutions reflect the systems that already exist. Qualitative data, by contrast, is not bound by historical events. By including participants' and stakeholders' hopes, impressions, and, yes, emotions, as data, solutions generated by qualitative data-based research approaches can imagine wholly new systems from that which already exist. These solutions can support incremental <i>or</i> radical change, depending on the needs and desires of the participants and stakeholders. </p>
