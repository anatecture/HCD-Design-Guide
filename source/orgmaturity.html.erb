<h1>Design Maturity Model</h1>
<h2>Six Principles for organizations</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This section draws from the work of <a href= "https://www.uie.com/">Jared Stool</a> and <a href= "https://www.thisishcd.com/episodes/20-marc-stickdorn-embedding-service-design-into-organisations/">Marc Stickdorn</a>. These principles are applied in the multi-year overhaul of the USA Jobs and USA Hiring
  sites.
</p>

<p>These principles’ distillation respresents the point at which the project had to move from the explict, daily collaboration between The Lab team and the hiring partners to a more implementation-based team.
</p>

<h3>What is an organization’s design maturity?</h3>
<p>When we talk about about organization’s design maturity, we’re broadly referring to its focus on participants, both current and imagined, its knowledge of them, and its willingess to pivot around them. A design-led and design-mature organization is able to make changes participants desire while attaining buy-in from the broad organization. Thinking back to the Design Principles, in this organizational culture, participants are defined broadly to include not on the organizationally external partners but also those internal to the organization — including the designers, leadership, and employees themselves. </p>

<p>This maturity is not necessarily wholesale or all-or-nothing: many organizations embody differing levels of design maturity at different points in their structures. Throughout this section, we will use the US Postal Service (USPS) as an example of one such organization.</p>

<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<p>Why go to the trouble of trying to create a design-led organization? Organizational change is difficult, time-consuming, and subject to so many markers and milestones that it can seem exhausting to try. There are two compelling reasons why: (1) to better serve the widest definition of participants and (2) to improve business opportunities. The mission of any public organization is, of course, to function for the public: that is the core. If, by striving to become an organization that actively embraces and focuses on the public instead of one that does not, that organization will better fulfill its mission. Additionally, by practicing participant-focus and pivoting with them through expected/desired as well as unexpected/undesired changes, an organization can meet, exceed, and create new business opportunities for itself. </p>

<h2>Practices of a Design-led Organization</h2>
<h3>Shared Vision</h3>
<p>Continously imagine the experience of using our awesome product or service be like 5 years from the current point.</p>
<h3>Immersive Exposure</h3>
<p>Define the experience we’re currently delivering to our customers and users through embracing regular exposure to participants. (A good rule of thumb is 2 hours every 8 weeks for all teams members.)</p>
<p>Learn from mistakes. Good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgments.</p>
<h3>Continual Learning</h3>
<p>What does our organization need to learn to deliver great products and services in the future?<br>
  Keep refining what we think we know.<br>
  What do we know about our users?
  <br>
  What do we know about our products and services?
  <br>
  What do we know about the users’ unsolved problems and challenges?</p>

<h3>Customer Experience (CX) tied to personal performance</h3>
<p>Are we measuring the customer (user) experience and how is that tied to personnel performance? Measure outcomes across organizational groups (Program Offices).
</p>
<h3>Prototypes over PowerPoints
</h3>
<p>Does the organization value prototypes? If it took you a week to prepare a presentation why didn’t you invest that week demonstrating that your idea could really work?</p>
<h3>Qualitative & Quantitative research across the organization
</h3>
<p>Does the organization collect and trust Qual & Quant with equal measure?

  Keeping users at the center of the discussion is essential for becoming design-infused. If everyone, including the most distant of influencers, are involved in those discussions, it’s hard to avoid making a better user experience.
