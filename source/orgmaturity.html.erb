<h1>Design Maturity Model</h1>
<h2>Six Principles for organizations</h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This section draws from the work of <a href= "https://www.uie.com/">Jared Spool</a> and <a href= "https://www.thisishcd.com/episodes/20-marc-stickdorn-embedding-service-design-into-organisations/">Marc Stickdorn</a>. The Lab derrived these principles over our multi-year overhaul of the USA Jobs website, and, as we enter a new phase of our partnership in that effort, consider them crucial to the evolution of USA Hiring into a desing-led, participant-focused organization.
</p>

<h3>What is an organization’s design maturity?</h3>
<p>When we talk about about organization’s design maturity, we broadly refer to its focus on participants, both current and future, its knowledge of them, and its willingess to pivot and change with them. A design-led and design-mature organization is able to make changes participants desire while attaining buy-in from the organization at large. Additionally, as was outlined by the <a href= "participants.html">Participants</a> Design Principle, in an organizational culture like this, participants are defined to include not on the external partners but also those internal to the organization — including the designers, leadership, and employees themselves. </p>

<p>This maturity is not necessarily wholesale or all-or-nothing: many organizations embody differing levels of design maturity at different points in their structures. This means that, even if you’re part of a team of four or five inside a group of hundreds of employees, embedded in an organization of thousands, you can start the evolution towards a design-led organization. Through a series of small steps, the impact of design-led and participant-focused work can be transformative on many levels. The public sector has many examples of this type of asymmetric, under-the-hood organizational change. Throughout this section, we will use the US Postal Service (USPS) as an example of one such organization.</p>

<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<p>Why go to the trouble of trying to create a design-led organization? Organizational change is difficult, time-consuming, and subject to so many to-be-determined milestones that it can seem exhausting to try.</p>

<p>However, there are two compelling reasons why the effort is worth the trouble:</p>
  <ol>
    (1) This evolution will position the organization to better serve the widest definition of participants not just now but also in the future.</br>
    (2) Being a design-led organization will greatly increase business opportunities.
  </ol>
  <p>The mission of any public organization is, of course, to function for the public: that is the core. If, by striving to become an organization that actively embraces and focuses on the public instead of one that does not, that organization will better fulfill its mission. Additionally, by practicing participant-focus and pivoting with them through expected/desired as well as unexpected/undesired changes, an organization can meet, exceed, and create new business opportunities for itself. </p>

<h2>Levels of Design Maturity</h2>
In evaluating an organization or building milestones for an evolution to becoming one, design consultants Rosa Wu and Jess McMullin have derrived five key levels of design-led maturity for organizations, in their article <a href= "https://blog.situ.org/design-maturity-2005-2017-ea9b4f74cc3">Investing in Design</a>. From least mature to most, these maturity levels map our organizations in which design is:
<ol>
1) <b>Unconscious:</b> Things come out the way the do by default, because the organization believs that there are more important things to do. <br>
2) <b>Fashion:</b> Style and on-brandedness is paramount. Design is cosmetic.<br>
3) <b>Funtional:</b> This is a classic design orientation, focused on incremental improvements to products which may or may not need improvement. <br>
4) <b>Fixing:</b> Design process is used to generate multiple opportunities in any given space. <br>
5) <b>Framing:</b> Organization is open to questioning current practices, values, and outcomes  in pursuit of constant human-centered improvement.
</ol>

<h2>Practices of a Design-led Organization</h2>
<h3>Shared Vision</h3>
<p>Continously imagine the experience of using our awesome product or service be like 5 years from the current point.</p>
<h3>Immersive Exposure</h3>
<p>Define the experience we’re currently delivering to our customers and users through embracing regular exposure to participants. (A good rule of thumb is 2 hours every 8 weeks for all teams members.)</p>
<p>Learn from mistakes. Good judgment comes from experience and experience comes from bad judgments.</p>
<h3>Continual Learning</h3>
<p>What does our organization need to learn to deliver great products and services in the future?<br>
  Keep refining what we think we know.<br>
  What do we know about our users?
  <br>
  What do we know about our products and services?
  <br>
  What do we know about the users’ unsolved problems and challenges?</p>

<h3>Customer Experience (CX) tied to personal performance</h3>
<p>Are we measuring the customer (user) experience and how is that tied to personnel performance? Measure outcomes across organizational groups (Program Offices).
</p>
<h3>Prototypes over PowerPoints
</h3>
<p>Does the organization value prototypes? If it took you a week to prepare a presentation why didn’t you invest that week demonstrating that your idea could really work?</p>
<h3>Qualitative & Quantitative research across the organization
</h3>
<p>Does the organization collect and trust Qual & Quant with equal measure?

  Keeping users at the center of the discussion is essential for becoming design-infused. If everyone, including the most distant of influencers, are involved in those discussions, it’s hard to avoid making a better user experience.
