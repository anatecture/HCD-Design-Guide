<h1>Design Phase Principles</h1>
<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>When in the Design Phase, keep in mind the following principles. We’ll go through them in more detail in the following sections:</p>
<ol class="usa-list">
  <li>Getting to Simple is Hard</li>
  <li>No Solitary Geniuses</li>
  <li>In Their Shoes</li>
  <li>Consider Potential Change</li>
  <li>Value New Participants</li>
  <li>Plan For Long Term Use</li>
  <li>Serve Everyone; Define Your Audience</li>
  <li>Wait for the Right Opportunity</li>
  <li>Designs Have a Life Cycle</li>
</ol>

<h2>What are the things we design in the Government?</h2>
<p>The government does not have a product or product suite that it sells, and it does not package a variety of services to sell at a profit, as private companies do. For this reason, you might be asking yourself, "Well, what designs does the public sector actually need? Why do we need design in the government, anyway?". In fact, the public sector constantly designs products and services. Just because they're not offered for sale does not mean that they don't exist or aren't, in fact "real" products and services. They just function for public service instead of for commercial offerings.
</p>
<p>Traditionally, public sector products and services were designed largely from a policy angle. Policy makers and subject matter experts would look at data and create the products and services they believed were needed. More recently, however, government entities have realized that harnessing the power of design-specific methodologies like Human-Centered Design and specialized design practitioners could be result in more effective and more sustainable product and service solutions.
</p>
<p>So what are some examples of public sector design? Examples of public service product design include drivers' licenses, building permit applications, and interstate signage, while examples of public sector service design include the free school lunch program, the Medicare system, and the National Park System. Each of these examples have roots in laws,
  policies, and initiatives from legislatures, agencies, and other government bodies, but to grow the ideas from their roots into a functional product or service requires a design process — whether conscious, careful, and intentional, or not.
</p>
<p>A big distinction between products and services is as follows: sometimes services are single entites, like the National Park System. But that over-arching, large-scale service of maintaining parkland is built from many different, componenet product and services that work as a whole. One may think of National Parks as just a bunch of open air that's maintained by the Department of Interior, but the system's component services include wilderness preservation services, scientific research opportunities, and natural resource maintenence. Some of its component products include signage, websites, apps, uniforms, housing, and many others. We discuss this further in the <a href= "productsservices.html.erb">Products & Services</a> section.
