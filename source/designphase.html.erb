<h1>Design Phase Principles</h1>
<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>When in the Design Phase, keep in mind the following principles. We’ll go through them in more detail in the following pages:</p>
<ol class="usa-list">
  <li>Getting to Simple is Hard
  </li>
  <li>No Solitary Geniuses</li>
  <li>It Takes All Kinds (to Make the World Go ‘Round)</li>
  <li>Consider New Participants</li>
  <li>Value New Participants</li>
  <li>Public Sector Differs from Private Sector</li>
  <li>Public Sector Serves Everyone</li>
  <li>Define Your Audience</li>
  <li>Design is not permanent</li>
</ol>

<h2>What are the things we design in the Government?</h2>
<p>The government does not have a product or product suite that it sells; it does not construct services and offerings packaged to sell, as private companies do. For this reason, you might be asking yourself, "Well, what designs does the public sector need? Why do we need design in the government, anyway?".
</p>
<p>While the first part of that statement is true, the second part is not. In fact, the public sector constantly designs products and services. Traditionally, public sector products and services were designed largely from a policy angle. Policy makers and subject matter experts would look at data and create the products and services they believed were needed. More recently, however, government entities have realized that harnessing the power of design-specific methodologies like Human-Centered Design and specialized design practitioners could be result in more effective, more sustainable product and service solutions.
</p>
<p>A driver’s license, an application for a building permit, and interstate signage are all designed objects; pedestrian crosswalks, the Medicare system, and the National Park System are all designed services. Each of these examples have roots in laws,
  policies, and initiatives from legislatures, agencies, and other government bodies, however, to grow the ideas from their roots into a functional product or service requires a design process — whether conscious, careful, and intentional, or not.
</p>
<p>Oftentimes, a service is underpinned by many products. As an example, think of the National Park System. One may think of National Parks as just a bunch of open air, but it is in fact a collection of services including wilderness preservation
  services and scientific research opportunities. It is supported by various products, including signage, websites, apps, uniforms, housing, and others.
