<h1>Purpose of this Guide</h1>
<p>The purpose of this Design Guide and its sister Design Ops (TBA) is not to make an exhaustive list of design processes. There are many other works can do that for you, some of which are cited in this Field Guide. It is, instead, to provide context and some select methods for designing objects and processes that will help solve the problems discovered during the research phase and meet the needs of your identified audience. Beyond the methods, however, we hope you will focus on context and learning the Why behind the How. After learning the Why, you will be able to cross-apply the contents of these Guides to other situations in your work and life, expanding your understanding of complex problems and eventually contributing back to this work with orignal methods of your own making. That, in fact, would be the author's and sponsors' greatest measure of success: for you to take what you have learned here and create original work from your learnings.</p>
<p>Throughout this work, we will refer to the people for whom we’re designing as participants. Not users; not customers. Because the people for whom we’re designing are <i>participating</i> in our system and with our objects. They are <i>active</i>, while users and customers receive prodcuts and services. This creates either a supplicating <i>(i.e., please give me the thing or service)</i> or an entitled <i>(e.g., I deserve the thing or service without reservation and in the exact way I want it)</i> orientation. Both the designers and the people for whom the designed product(s) and service(s) are made are participating in this process. Participants are equal to us; we are equal to the participants. The participants in this process of both creating and using the product(s)/service(s) are equal since, while the designers create the primary, prototype product or service, they can only create a useful and usable  end product/service if they think like and seek the collaboration of those who will use the product/service, and through their use or lack of use, will change the product/service. It is difficult to choose a word to describe those for whom we work; however, if we, as designers, don’t consider that person/those people as equal to us because they are participants in “our” product(s)/service(s), then we will fail to include them in the creative process, which will ultimately leave out many of those who need the product/service. We need to think of the creative process as a continuum that includes both designers/builders and users. We are all participants. Participation indicates relationship, and we are in relationships with our products, services, and with everyone who uses them. Thus, for the purpose of adequately identifying the participants in what we are creating, the end-users will be called user-participants in this project.

<p>Public sector workers design both objects and services. Many times, a service is supported by a specialized product, such as a form, booth, electronic device, or other tool, or even multiple objects of the same or different types. For this reason, in this Field Guide, we will the refer to the design of products, or specialized objects, and the design of services, in which a product or many products are used.  </p>
