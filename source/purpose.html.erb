<h1>Purpose of this Guide</h1>
<p>The purpose of this Design Guide and its sister Design Ops Guide (TBA) is not to make an exhaustive list of design processes. There are many other works can do that for you, some of which we cite throughout this work. The purpose of this guide is, to provide context and some select methods for designing products and services that will help solve the problems highlighted from your Discovery phase. While the Ops Guide will focus on the How of the making process, this Context Guide helps you understand the Why behind the How. After learning the Why, you will be able to cross-apply the contents of these Guides to other situations in your work and life, expanding your understanding of complex problems and eventually contributing back to this work with orignal methods of your own making. That, in fact, would be the author's and sponsors' greatest measure of success: for you to take what you have learned here and create original work from your learnings.</p>
<p>Throughout this work, we will refer to the people for whom we’re designing as participants. This is because the people for whom we’re designing are <i>participating</i> in the use of the products and services we design. They might use them in different ways than we intended, adapting them to their own needs, or they might use them for a while and abandon them. In this way, the participants have an active role in the life cycle of our work. </p>

<p>In contrast, thinking of participants as "users" or "customers" sidelines them into simply receiving products and services. This creates either a supplicant <i>(i.e., please give me the thing or service)</i> or an entitled <i>(e.g., I deserve the thing or service without reservation and in the exact way I want it)</i> orientation. This orientation separates the organizations and design teams from the participants. </p>

<p>In Human-Centered Design, both the designers and the people for whom the designed product(s) and service(s) are made participate in the design, use, and evaluation processes. Participants are equal to the design team and the organization, and design is driven primarily by participant. While the designers create the prototypes or models for product or service solutions to participant needs, they can only refine these products and services through continued collaboration with the participants throughout the design process. </p>
