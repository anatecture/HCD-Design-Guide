<h3>Products</h3>
  <p>Products are defined by economists as made, or manufactured, objects, typically created in a factory setting. They tend to be    single-instance interactions between buyer and seller. Even if you go to a coffee shop and buy a coffee every day, each purchase of that  coffee is a new event; the coffee is the product, while the coffee shop is providing the service of selling coffee. You buy and consume new coffee everyday, but the service of providing that new coffee, the touchpoints, the culture, and the community of the coffee shop, is ongoing and intangible.</p>
  <br>
  <p> The Economist magazine defines products quite literally as something you "<a href="https://www.economist.com/economics-a-to-z/u#node-21529393">can drop on your foot</a>", and they're not joking. This definition, while appropriate, does not address some of the most important current products we interact with every day: digital products.</p>

<h2>Products-Service Spectrum</h2>
<h3>Tangible Products</h3>

<p>Most people think of these items when they think of products. They are tangible items like a phone or a bottle. In the public sector these items include driver's licenses and passports.</p>

<h3>Digital Products
</h3>

<p>This is a new but important category of product. Digital products include items you may use everyday like work processing programs or photo apps. Government examples include the digital photos of animals from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, and the digital archiving system from the National Archives.

<h3>Products that set constraints around services
</h3>

<p>Products like these are used to box in a service so that consumers can use it in pieces or at certain scales. In the private sector, they include items like insurance, which box in insurance services to include a certain package of services on offer at a certain price point. In the public sector, they include things like drivers' licenses classifications. The service of licensing drivers is the umbrella offering; the classifications allow people to use that service at different levels. For example, CDL drivers are the licensed to pilot a vehicles over a certain number of axles or a certain weight, while a class C license limits the driver to smaller vehicles.</p>

<h3>Products that give access to services</h3>
<p><img src="/images/productservices-03.svg" alt="Products that give access to services"></p>
<p>Products like these are necessary to access services. Private sector examples include video streaming interfaces: without the interface, the video streaming service might exist, but no one would be able to acces it. A good public sector example is New York City's 311 service, which exists as a call center that routes calls as well as a mobile app. Without the product of the phone line or the app, New York City might offer services for non-emergencies, but New Yorkers would not be able to access them.</p>

<h3>Products that augment a service
</h3>

  <p>Products that augment a service are not necessarily needed to constrain or access the service, but they do make using the service more delightful or easy. A private sector example is a to-go coffee cup: while coffee can always be served in multiple-use cups, to-go cups, whether multiple or single use, create a different way to use a coffee service. A public sector example includes the Welcome Kit from the Department of Veterans Affairs. While the Welcome Kit is not strictly necessary for accessing all of VA's services and benefits, it certainly makes those services and benefits easier and more delightful to navigate.</p>
