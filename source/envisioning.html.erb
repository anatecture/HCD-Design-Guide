<h1>Envisioning Design</h1>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The Design phase is all about creation. To aid idea expression and development, designers use non-verbal and non-text-based communication to show their ideas and thoughts in addition to talking and/or writing about them. This is because that, in the process of creating new things, whether product or service, it can be difficult to express the fullness of ideas verbally or in text, especially collaborativly and when the idea is still forming. </p>

<p>That being said, alternatives to verbal and text-based communication channels, like drawing, collaging, or model-making, aren't better than verbal- and text-based communications; instead, each channel answers a specific set of needs. If talking about the changes you're thinking of making to an existing system is confusing, why not draw it? If you can't really describe a better visual-impairment melody for a system to play when people log in, why not hum it, record it on your phone, and email that instead? Drawing, building, collaging, or recording our ideas is faster, more clear, and more actionable than just talking or writing about them.</p></p>

<b>Advantages to Showing & Telling Ideas in the Design Process:</b>
<ul>
  <li> Showing as well as telling allows vague or complex ideas can start to take shape rapidly. These concrete items, like drawings or models, retain their shape while words fly about and sometimes get lost, forgotten, or misunderstood.</li>
  <li> Making a collage, a drawing, or building a model of an idea brings the idea away from the individual into a stand-alone space so that it can be evaluated without attaching evaluation to the individual.</li>
  <li> By layering showing and telling, designers can communicate more complexity than if they stayed with either showing or telling. </li>
</ul>


  <h2>Using References: Communicating Happiness</h2>

  <p><img src="/images/sunny_flower.svg" class="square_left" alt="sunny flower">When designers need to talk about abstract concepts or convey a feeling, they often use any of those alternate forms of communication to do so. These photos, drawings, recordings, et cetera, are called "references" because you should "reference" them when reading the text or listening to the presentation that accompanies them. In the example below, the designer wants to describe something that is sunny, and has collected the image examples to talk about what they mean when they talk about sunny.
  </p>

  <p><img src="/images/sunny_logo.svg" class="square_right" alt="sunny logo">
    None of the photos in this section are actually happy. The logo uses a sun-like form that seems like it might be quite happy and optimistic; one is a photograph of a happy looking, healthy (and fried egg-like) flower on a sunny day, while the third is a photo of a beach on a sunny day, which many people associate with happiness. <!--while the third are some words that make no literal sense (you can't walk on sunshine) but their shape and color is happy.-->So none of these things are actually pictures of happiness. But what is a picture of happiness? There isn't one, because it's different for all of us. This is why using references is so useful when talking about abstract concepts like happiness.

        This photograph of binders and folders with paper conveys complex ideas depending on how the photo is interpreted. Is the photograph meant to convey productivity or overwork? Organization or disorganization? Possibilities like this are why telling is
        also an important part of showing: text and images work together; they are not replacements for each other.

    To communicate verbally or in written form about the concept of “happiness”, writers must use a lot of words to communicate. Words like "positive", "sunny", "enthusiastic", and so many more. But since words are subjective, meaning that each of them means something slightly different to all of us, sequential, meaning that, when used in sentences, they're subject to structural rules, they are very good when precise meaning is possible, but less effective when multiple meanings are needed to be conveyed simultaneously or when a concept is vague or multi-faceted.
    </p>
    <p>Again, none of this is to say that drawing, collaging, model-making, et cetera, is more precise than words all the time, but that combining these options with words  makes your communications simultaneously more precise and more dense. Using both, your communicaitons can convey more ideas in a shorter span of time than just using one method or the other can. Even if someone is not practiced at drawing or making models, the act of drawing or making itself allows people to follow the creative logic of the solution, while descriptive words elaborate on that logic. This is helpful for getting everyone on the same page as well as for starting to explore design ideas.</p>

    <h2>This is Just Show And Tell</h2>
    <p>In grade school, many students in the United States engage in a game called “Show and Tell”. In this exercise, students bring in an object they think is interesting, show it to the class, and then tell the class something about that object.
    </p>
    <p>One of the purposes of this exercise is to teach students about representational forms. For example, although a student cannot bring to class the hike in the woods they took over the weekend, they can bring the cool rock they picked up on that hike as a representation of what they did. By connecting the tangible rocks with the intangible hike, students are able to make generalizable connections about the elements of a hike, where to find rocks, and what future hikes or rocks might be like.
    </p>
    <p>As adults, images and objects function in the same way: the visualization allows for general communication about an experience, substance, process, etc. that cannot be present. For this reason, the old game of show and tell as useful in meetings as it was in your grade school’s class.

      <p> Important to Note: Understand that different cultures assign different meanings to shapes, colors, gestural forms, and groupings, the same way different parts of the US assign different meanings to words (try ordering a pop in a restaurant in the South. No one will know what you're talking about.) For this reason, if the design work is to be shared across languages or cultures, some research is required to ensure that the work retains the intended impact across all audiences.
