<h1>Envisioning Design</h1>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The Design phase is all about creation. In creating new things, whether product or service, it can be difficult to express the fullness of our ideas verbally or in text, especially as teammates begin to dig into the ideas and try to understand them. To aid our idea expression and development, designers use non-verbal or textual communication to show their ideas and thoughts in addition to talking and/or writing about them. These alternatives include: drawing, collaging, and three dimensional model-building. There are two broad advantages to combining showing with telling:</p>

<ul>
  <li> Showing as well as telling allows vague or complex ideas can start to take shape rapidly. These concrete items, like drawings or models, retain their shape while words fly about and sometimes get lost, forgotten, or misunderstood.</li>
  <li> Making a collage, a drawing, or building a model of an idea brings the idea away from the individual into a stand-alone space so that it can be evaluated without attaching evaluation to the individual.</li>
  <li> By layering showing and telling, designers can communicate more complexity than if they stayed with either showing or telling. </li>
</ul>

    <h2>Visual Communication</h2>
    <p>Why draw your thoughts? If we have spent a lifetime reading articles and writing text and having verbal conversations, what could be the positive results of literally staring at a drawing board? We have writing skills: why start back at the
      beginning with drawing?
    </p>
      <p>In short: because drawing ideas is faster, more clear, and more actionable than just talking about them.</p>
      <br>

  <h2>Communicating Sunny-ness</h2>
    <img src="/images/sunny_flower.svg" class="square_left" alt="sunny flower">

    <p>
      None of the photos in this section are actually sunny. One is a sunny looking logo; one is a photograph of a flower that is itself quite sunny (and fried egg-like), on a sunny day, while the third is a photo of a beach with some sun. <!--while the third are some words that make no literal sense (you can't walk on sunshine) but their shape and color is happy.-->So none of these things are sunny. But we can use any of these to help tell each other what we mean when we mean "sunny". Do we mean literally sunny, as in the photo of the flower and the beach? Or a reference of sunniness, like in the illustration?
    </p>

    <img src="/images/sunny_logo.svg" class="square_right" alt="sunny logo">
    <p>When meeting as a design team to start thinking of ideas for design solutions, you might say "I'm thinking it needs to be sunny." and that could be interpreted as any one of the meanings of "sunny" shown above. However, if you show an example of what you mean when you mean sunny, by showing the typeface or sketching a logo or even showing the beach, you'll be able to communicate to the team more precisely what you're thinking. This is the function of layering verbal and written communications with other forms in the design process.</p>

        This photograph of binders and folders with paper conveys complex ideas depending on how the photo is interpreted. Is the photograph meant to convey productivity or overwork? Organization or disorganization? Possibilities like this are why telling is
        also an important part of showing: text and images work together; they are not replacements for each other.

    <p>To communicate through verbally or in written form about concepts of “bright, sunny, and happy”, writers must use a lot of words to communicate. Since words are sequential and subject to rules, they are very good when precise meaning is possible, but less effective when multiple meanings are needed to be conveyed simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>This is not to say that drawing is more precise than words all the time, but that they are more dense. They can convey more ideas in a shorter span of time than words can. For this reason, drawing ideas, especially complex ones, is often more efficient than trying to describe them with words. Even if someone is not practiced at drawing, the act of drawing itself allows the descriptive words to become more precise as the team discusses the ideas depicted. This is helpful for getting
      everyone on the same page as well as for starting to explore design ideas.</p>

    <h2>This is Just Show And Tell</h2>
    <p>In grade school, many students in the United States engaged in a game called “Show and Tell”. In this exercise, students brought in an object they thought was interesting, show it to the class, and then tell the class something about that object.
    </p>
    <p>One of the purposes of this exercise is to teach students about representational forms: although a student cannot bring the hike in the woods with their parent to class, they can bring the cool rocks they picked up on that hike to class as a
      representation of what they did. By connecting the tangible rocks with the intangible hike, students were able to make generalizable connections about the elements of a hike, where to find rocks, and what future hikes or rocks might be like.
    </p>
    <p>As adults, images function in the same way: the visualization allows for general communication about an experience, substance, process, etc. that cannot be present. For this reason, the old game of show and tell as useful in meetings as it was in your grade school’s class.

    <h2>Case Study: Telehealth Toolkit Concept</h2>
    <p> text and slide pulls from the reference deck</p>

    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>One of the most difficult parts of design is working on the edge of the unknown. The diagrams and tangram analogy are here as guideposts to this process which, by its very definition, will result in the creation of new products and services that cannot be described here.
    </p>
    <h3>Checklist</h3>

      <span style="font-size: 1em; color: #2e8540;">
        <i class="fas fa-check"></i>
      </span>Ensure that your leadership and teammates are aware that you are actively entering the design phase. Letting them know can be formal or informal, depending on the culture of your workplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 1em; color: #2e8540;">
        <i class="fas fa-check"></i>
      </span>Ensure that each team member has your Insights and Opportunities from the Discovery phase.</p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-size: 1em; color: #2e8540;">

    <h3>Strategy</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Working with Unknown Elements</strong><br>
      Proxies, or stand-ins, can be useful when discusing a system that contains unknown elements, such as your future design product or service.
    </p>

    <p>When talking to your leadership or teammates, you can create a proxy to stand in for your future design. You can do this mathematically, as in, “We’ll call the design we’re going to make X,” or with humor, as in, “we’ll refer to our future design
      object as Squiggle,”. Making a stand in for your design will allow the team to converse around your designed product or service without needing to know exactly what it is. Stand in elements also allo you to map future phases, such as Delivery and
      Measurement.

    <h2>Using Tangrams
    </h2>
    <p>Throughout this work, we will use Tangrams as a way to talk about the cycle of ideation and iteration in the design phase. Tangrams are dissection puzzles consisting of seven flat shapes, called tans, which are put together to form shapes.
      Traditionally, a person playing with a tangram puzzle looks at an outline of a shape that has been created by using all seven tans with no overlaps. The player then tries to re-create that outline using their own tangram pieces. When they have
      successfully re-created that outline, they have solved the puzzle. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram)
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Why Tangrams?</strong>
      Tangrams present the unique benefit of allowing us to connect a concrete object, the tangram puzzle, with the concepts of ideation and iteration. Since a tangram puzzle allows us to create many shapes (new tangram shapes are still being discovered to
      this day), out of the same component parts, they present a useful parallel to your design problem. In your work, you have a need to create something new, but based on the research, insights, and opportunities you identified in the Discovery phase.
      Additionally, like the constraining rules of a the tangram puzzle game, many times your solutions will need to operate inside of or address some strict constraints, themselves.
    </p>
    <h2>Tangram Shapes
    </h2>
    <p>
      <img src="/images/envisioning-tangram_shapes.svg" alt="Tangram shapes">
    </p>
    <p>Above are the seven shapes in each tangram set. Their proportions, or sizes, are based off of a single unit of measure that can be any measurement of distance, such as an inch or a centimeter. Because the proportions are fixed, the scale is
      infinate: You could scale a tangram set up to the size of a building or even a landscape, if you had enough space.</p>

      <p> Important to Note: Understand that different cultures assign different meanings to shapes, colors, gestural forms, and groupings, the same way different parts of the US assign different meanings to words (try ordering a pop in a restaurant in the South. No one will know what you're talking about.) For this reason, if the design work is to be shared across languages or cultures, some research is required to ensure that the work retains the intended impact across all audiences.
