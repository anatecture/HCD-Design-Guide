<h1>Services</h1>

<h3>Services</h3>
<p>According to economists, services are items that are not manufactured and are typically delivered on-demand. They tend to be ongoing, or things you return to again and again, unlike the single-instance events that characterize products.</p>

  <p>Going back to our coffee shop example, while the coffee you drink is a new product every day, the coffee shop provides the ongoing service of stocking, making, and selling coffee. The touchpoints of the transaction, the culture and community of the coffee shop, are components of the shop's service, which is ongoing and intangible.
<br>
<p>Examples of services and a case study of public sector services are forthcoming.</p>
