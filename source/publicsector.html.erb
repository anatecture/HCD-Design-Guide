<h1>Design in the Public Sector</h1>
<h2>Plan for Long Term Use</h2>
<p>
<strong>Differences in Need</strong><br>
Design in the Public Sector can seem a slower, more complicated affair than its Private Sector counterpart. However, each sector has its own unique values and pressures, terms to fulfill, and spaces to explore. While the Private Sector is pressured by a constant need for increasing profit and the short-term thinking that this challenge requires, the Public Sector must respond to and support the public through the long life spans we now enjoy, which means planning ahead for decades of growth and change.

<h3>Case In Point</h3>
  <p><strong>Building Resilient Buildings: The New Orleans VA Medical Center</strong></p>

    <p>In talking about New Orleans, one cannot avoid talking about Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The citizens of that famous city speak of “before the storm” and “after the storm” as markers of time and radical change. Katrina brought disasterous flooding and shut down to the 50-year-old VA Medical Center (VAMC) in New Orleans, causing suffering to some of the city's most vulnerable residents. </p>

    <p>In 2016, the city reopened its VA Medical Center. In building this new facility, VA and its partners chose to plan for more storms like Katrina, instead of chalking it up on a once-in-a-century event. In order to plan for another violent storm and flooding even, the building features bed capacity for housing people through electrical outages and a boat landing on the second floor. The planners anticipated that the building might be in use for another 50 years, and that those 50 years are full of unknowns. The result is a facility that works not only for the current healthcare of the approximately 70,000 veterans in the Gulf Coast region, but also the community surrounding the facility itself and that community's potential, critical need.



<h2>Serve Everyone; Define Your Audience</h2>
<p>Design in the Public Sector means designing for all groups living or affected by the system for which we design. Whether of differing abilities, backgrounds, or worldviews, ages, or practices, design in the Public Sector must allow each group to
  access products and services. This means that the research and testing groups necessary for this space are massive, but must be addressed.</p>

<h3>Case In Point</h3>
<p><strong>VA's Patient Advocacy Tracking System (PATS)</strong></p>
<p>The Patient Advocacy Tracking System (PATS) is not a glamorous softward product. At its core, it is a data-entry system used by Patient Advocates, who are non-clinical service providers in VA Medical Centers. But its function is incredibly important: to record complaints and compliements veterans have inside VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and to track their path to resolution, if they are complaints, or their disseminiation, if complements. The numbers generated by the PATS system are vital to the medical centers as a dataset, but those numbers, configured in various ways, can return different results according to the audience's values, assumptions and biases. For example, administrators pull PATS numbers to track performance; medical professionals need them for insights into how veterans and caregivers perceive their care; and the Patient Advocates themselves, who take on the primary and follow-up interactions with the veterans and track and forward the resolution of complaints. Given this diverse group, should the software attempt to answer all their questions and needs, or should it focus on working best for one set of participants? And if for one set, whose values should be most supported in a redesign?</p>

<p>In preparing for just such a redesign, the Veterans Experience Office and The Lab partnered to parse the data and define the audience. While part of the redesign effort was supposed to include an expansion of the resolution process to the different medical service lines, the research VEO and The Lab undertook showed that those service lines would not necessarily be able to take on this task in addition to their normal medical work. In response to this research, the team decided to design the system for the needs of the Patient Advocates themselves, as they touched the system most often and would, according to our research, continue to manage the resolution process, even if they worked more closely with the medical lines to enact that process in the future.</p>

<p>For this reason, the software interface The Lab designed focuses on the needs of the Patient Advocates in their daily work: a large, open text box for notes; search by name and last four digits of social security numbers, and the ability to have multiple cases open at once. While the system will still allow healthcare providers to access complaints and compliments and be part of the process, and it will still allow administrators to pull performance numbers, it answers the needs of the audience that interacts with it most often as its primary design value. In this way, the PATS redesign is an example of supporting multiple participants, but highly defining one's primary audience.</p>

<strong>Not exclusion; precision</strong><br>
Due to the large potential audience in the public sector design, the sheer number of people for whom one is designing can be intimidating. To get it right, to include everyone, to consider all the angles, are all pressures design teams feel throughout their process. How, then, can a team effectively design for such a massive number of people as the entire public? The answer is that designers must define the audiences for their work. An imporant disinction here is precision in design, not exclusion to design. We have to be fair and inclusive of all people, which means designing at a precise scale of product, as opposed to a small scale of people. </p>

<p>Design teams primarily define their audiences through the problem framing process during the Discovery phase. In the Design phase, teams may need to redefine their audience to a more precise scope, as the team ideates product and service solutions based on the opportunities they identified in the Systhesis portion of Discovery. A case study of this audience definition and and redefinion can be found in the development story for the Department of Veterans Affairs Welcome to Telehealth Kit.
