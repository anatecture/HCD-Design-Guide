<h1>Building Out Ideas</h1>

<h3>Using Collections of References for Ideation</h3>
<p>
As design teams begin to ideate, they start to create collections of references, often called Reference Decks, to help show their ideas. By accompanying these collections of references with words, whether written or verbal, the team can more easily understand what it collectively  is thinking or what an individual teammate is thinking, keep a record of that thinking, and edit the idea.
</p>
<p>
Because the team is creating something new, there's no exact photo or sketch or recording of it that exists. For this reason, it’s essential to develop a collection of references that are like the product, service, or system you’re envisioning in order to express all your thoughts on how a design might look, feel, and function. The purpose of using references, whether drawn, photographed, recorded, et cetera, is to meet four primary goals:
  <br>
  <ul class="usa-list">
    <li>To
      <strong>explore</strong>
      nuances in a proposal, system, or idea.</li>
    <li>To
      <strong>understand</strong>
      those nuances.</li>
    <li>To
      <strong>clarify</strong>
      those nuances, especially if they act within a complex system.</li>
    <li>To
      <strong>communicate</strong>
      the steps above to others who may or may not be present in design meetings.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Exploring Happiness</h3>
<p>
Returning to the references for "happiness", as seen in the  <a href= "../envisioning.html">Envisioning Design</a> section, how might they each inform an overall idea of a product or service?
</p>

<img src="/images/talking.svg" class= "square_center" alt="basic outline of two people's heads with open mouths indicating talking">
<p class= "square_center">
This line drawing shows two people talking. They seem to be facing each other, and their little, line-drawing eyes communicate pleasure. This seems to indicate that the idea of happiness in this product, service, or system has to do with human connection and communication as a form or components of happiness.
</p>

<img src="/images/sunny_logo.svg" class= "square_center" alt="sunny logo">
<p class= "square_center">
The flag in this graphic seems to indicate that the product, service, or system will be related to the United States of America, while the graphic sun conveys optimism and hope. This item also introduces ideas for the form of the product, service, or system the team member has in mind. According to this reference, the expression of happiness in this product is modern, clean, and minimal.
</p>

<img src="/images/walking.svg" class= "square_center" alt="text reading I'm walking on sunshine in a font that is squishy like toothpaste.">
<p class= "square_center">
This bouncy text not only communicates the idea of movement and joy, but also, like the logo, informs the form of the idea through the use of a distinct typeface.
</p>

<img src="/images/sunny_beach.svg" class= "square_center" alt="sunny beach">
<p class= "square_center">
The image of the beach conveys ideas of happiness associated with being outside in the natural world, serenity, and peace.
</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>
If these four images were a teammate's reference deck, what might be a few ideas to take from it? One might be that the product, service, or system that the teammate envisions has to do with happiness as a social connection, away from work, in a light-hearted environment such as community engagement or outdoor exercise opportunities for veterans or school children. Because this is only an example, one might take away many ideas from it. For a more precise undertanding of the idea, the reference deck would need to be built out more fully, preferably accompanied by verbal or written cues as well.

<h3>Case Study: Reference Decks</h3>
  <h4>Telehealth Toolkit</h4>

  <p>
    The Telehealth Toolkit is a <a href= "https://telehealth-toolkit.netlify.com/home">prototype knowledge-sharing repository</a> designed for the Office of Telehealth in the Veterans Health Administration. This reference deck uses examples from several well-known, well-organized sites that share knowledge in different ways.  Multiple ideas for the Toolkit are described by the aspects of each site that is highlighted.
  </p>

  <p>
    This deck is from the very beginning of the design team's design phase for this digital product. At the beginning of the design process, the deck refers to the product as the “Genius Bar”; however, the final name is the Telehealth Toolkit. This change is typical of reference decks.  Because they’re begun so early in the design process, they’re often called by different names from the final name iteration, since the information and references that decks contain are simply the starting point for the iterated design process.
